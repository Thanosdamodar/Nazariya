            Hey everyone, I’m back! And honestly, I never thought I’d miss photography this much. It has been a part of me ever since I discovered my passion for it, 
            and I’ve always wanted to do more—push my limits, chase new frames, and tell stories through my lens.<br><br>
            It all started back in my first year of college. What began as just an extracurricular activity quickly turned into something much bigger. Before I knew 
            it, I was exploring every corner of my city, searching for untold stories to capture. I travelled to the farthest, most rugged parts of the country, just 
            to take that one perfect shot—like a souvenir, a piece of a place to keep with me forever. And the journey that ignited it all? My first trip to Ladakh. 
            That’s where my love for photography truly took flight.<br><br>
            But then, life happened. In the blink of an eye, those frequent escapes into photography turned into rare moments. Weekly photo walks became monthly, then 
            yearly. The challenges I set for myself, the little creative projects, the thrill of capturing something new—all of it started slipping away. And I missed 
            it. I missed the rush, the adventure, the way photography made me see the world differently.<br><br>
            But no more. I’ve decided to make time. To pick up my camera again, not just to take pictures, but to share my stories—the beauty I’ve seen, the experiences 
            that shaped me, and the moments that made me feel alive.<br><br>
            I used to think my experiences were treasures meant just for me. But someone once told me that by sharing them, I could inspire others—to explore, to 
            appreciate, and to respect the cultures and landscapes that make our world so incredible. So that’s what I’m going to do. I’ll show you what I’ve seen, 
            tell you what not to miss, and maybe, just maybe, help you fall in love with the world the way I did.<br><br>
            To those who stuck around despite my absence, thank you. I promise to be more present, to bring you along on my adventures, and to share my world through my lens once again.<br><br>

            The Magic of Hemis Gompa Monastery<br><br>
            We landed in the early morning, greeted by the crisp mountain air and the quiet serenity of Ladakh. The hotel staff advised us to rest before beginning our 
            tour, but how could I? I had dreamed of this place for so long, imagining its ancient monasteries, prayer flags fluttering against the clear blue sky, and the whispers of monks chanting in harmony with 
            the wind. The excitement in me was unbearable. From my hotel window, I watched the golden rays of the rising sun bathe the mountains, itching to step outside and capture every moment.<br><br>
            Finally, at 10:30, we set out on our journey into this mystical world, our first stop—the famous Hemis Gompa Monastery.<br><br>
            “It is a Buddhist monastery located in Leh City, Ladakh,” our guide explained as we approached. “It belongs to the Drukpa lineage of Buddhism and was first established in the 11th century, 
            later re-established in the 17th century by the Ladakhi King Sengge Namgyal. It is also famous for its two-day religious ceremony, the Hemis Festival.”<br><br>
            Facts. You can find them anywhere. But what no guidebook could ever tell you is what it feels like to be here.<br><br>
            The moment I stepped inside, a wave of peace rushed through me, as if the very air carried whispers of wisdom and serenity. The towering walls, draped in centuries of history, seemed to hum with stories 
            of devotion and resilience. I reached out and spun a prayer wheel, watching it turn effortlessly under my fingers, sending prayers into the wind. A profound sense of calm washed over me.<br><br>
            My family, on the other hand, was creating their own version of serenity—by making a ruckus, excitedly pointing at everything and calling out to each other. But I couldn’t blame them. This place was a 
            world waiting to be explored, and we were merely travelers eager to embrace its beauty.<br><br>
            Then, amidst the chants and the quiet rustling of prayer flags, I noticed a little boy. He was struggling to reach the monastery’s large bell, jumping with all his might but always falling just short. 
            His tiny hands stretched towards it, determination glimmering in his eyes. For minutes, he kept trying.<br><br>
            Watching him, I nudged my brother. “Help him.”<br><br>
            Without hesitation, my brother lifted the child effortlessly, as if he were a stuffed toy. The boy’s face lit up with pure joy, his small fingers finally grasping the bell’s rope. He rang it with all 
            his might, the chime echoing through the monastery. A victorious smile spread across his face—bright, innocent, unforgettable.<br><br>
            I clicked the moment. And even now, it remains my favorite memory of the trip. Those small, sparkling eyes, that uncontainable happiness—it was a reminder of the simple joys that make life magical.<br><br>
            Hemis Gompa had already given me a gift—one that no souvenir ever could.<br><br>

            The Magic of Druk Padma Karpo School – Rancho’s School<br><br>
            After the serene experience at Hemis Gompa Monastery, our second and final stop of the day was one I had been looking forward to for years—Druk Padma Karpo School, 
            famously known as Rancho’s School from the movie 3 Idiots.<br><br>
            Being a huge fan of the film, I couldn’t contain my excitement. The hilarious scenes, the unforgettable dialogues, and the heartwarming story had made this place 
            almost legendary in my mind. Walking into the school felt surreal, as if I had stepped onto the very set of the movie.<br><br>
            The school was incredibly well-maintained, its walls still adorned with the same vibrant paintings seen in the film. It was fun pointing out different spots and 
            reenacting some of the funniest scenes with my family—we laughed, played around, and relived the joy that the movie had given us.<br><br>
            What made the visit even more meaningful was learning that the revenue collected from visitors was used for the education of the children and the upkeep of the 
            school. It wasn’t just a tourist attraction; it was a place that continued to nurture young minds and create a future for them.<br><br>
            As we explored, I noticed a striking new white building nestled between the mountains, standing like a symbol of progress and beauty. It was breathtaking. I 
            wished I could stay until sunset to watch the golden rays kiss its walls, turning it into something even more magical. But unfortunately, our tour guidelines 
            didn’t allow us to linger that long.<br><br>
            Still, the sight of children studying, playing, and curiously watching the visitors made me pause. I wondered what it must be like to study in a place like 
            this, surrounded by such majestic landscapes. How could anyone focus on books when the peaks and clouds outside seemed to whisper adventure?<br><br>
            Just imagine playing your favorite sport here, with the whole school cheering you on, the crisp mountain air filling your lungs. It wouldn’t feel like just 
            a school—it would feel like a dream.<br><br>
            As we left, I took one last look at the school, soaking in its beauty, its energy, and the memories it had given me. It wasn’t just Rancho’s School anymore—it 
            had become a part of my own story.<br><br>

            A Serendipitous Encounter with Peace.<br><br>
            On our way back, we made a stop at the local market. My family, excited by the colors and crafts, dove into shopping, but I couldn’t bring myself to do the same. 
            Markets didn’t hold my interest—I wanted to explore.<br><br>
            So, while they browsed, I wandered. Step by step, I drifted away from the chatter of vendors and the hum of negotiations, letting my feet guide me. After walking 
            about half a kilometer, I stumbled upon something breathtaking.<br><br>
            There, against the backdrop of towering mountains and an open sky, were rows of vibrant prayer flags, their colors dancing wildly in the rushing wind. I stood 
            still, mesmerized.<br><br>
            I’ve always been fascinated by the chants and hymns of Buddhism, their rhythmic cadence carrying a sense of ancient wisdom. The story of Buddha, as I had studied 
            in history, was remarkable in itself, but in this moment, I wasn’t just reading about it—I was feeling it.<br><br>
            The prayer flags, inscribed with sacred mantras, fluttered like they were waving at me, calling me closer, whispering, Come, read us. Each ribbon carried prayers 
            meant to be carried away by the wind, spreading blessings across the land.<br><br>
            I took a photo, capturing the magic, but as I lowered my camera, I realized something—this wasn’t just something to see; it was something to experience.<br><br>
            So, I sat down.<br><br>
            I let the moment wash over me, let the wind press against my skin, let my mind grow quiet. No thoughts, no rushing, no distractions. Just being.<br><br>
            For those few minutes, I wasn’t a traveler, a tourist, or even just an observer. I was simply there, part of something ancient, something peaceful, something 
            beyond words.<br><br>
            And that moment, more than any photograph, is what I chose to carry with me.<br><br>
